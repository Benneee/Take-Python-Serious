# Re-learning This Python

## Taking it more seriously this time

I like structured learning a lot. Also, when something has similarities with what I'm already familiar with, I can decide to go bonkers and build a few things
while shuttling between Google, the official docs and my text editor.

Anyway, because I love structured learning and Python is my first love, I decided to take a course in it. I found this course a long time ago and I fell in love with the instructor's method.
I decided to keep notes as well for reference purposes, so you can find comments in almost all the touched files.

The target is Django but knowing myself, I don't want to not understand something in a language before jumping into its framework, even if I don't understand everything, It would be brilliant to have an idea of what it's about.

Enough said, here's the course: [A UDEMY Python Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-to-code-with-python/)

Enjoy!
